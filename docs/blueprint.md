- The accent color will be a subdued blue-violet (#7B8EBC), for highlights and call-to-action elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) will be used. It has a modern, clean design and a touch of warmth.
- Use simple, minimalist icons to represent different types of meditations, exercises, and features. Icons should be in a style of the chosen primary or accent colors.
- Use a clean, grid-based layout for easy navigation and readability. Prioritize clear spacing and hierarchy.
- Implement subtle animations for transitions and feedback. Animations should be smooth and non-distracting to maintain a sense of calm.
